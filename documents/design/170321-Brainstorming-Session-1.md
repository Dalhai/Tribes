# Tribes of Dust

Hexagonal, Turn-based Tactics

The game is about finding water in a desertified fictional future of earth. The harsh conditions wiped out most of humanity and the remaining populace reverted back to a more tribal form of life. The main problem is water sources are limited and there's still too many people living on the planet for what remains. In the fight for water, strength prevails, the law of jungle rules. To ensure their continued survival, people joined forces, forming the tribes of dust. The game thus allows players to participate in a fight for survival as one of many tribes. The game throws you into one battle of a greater war. These battles start when one or more of the rare springs surface in the desert. However, these springs only surface for a very limited amount of time. Tribes have to be quick to gather the much needed water to ensure continued survival of their kin. Time has shown that these springs only carry enough water to the surface to keep a single tribe alive.


## Initial Content

The game requires at least 2 players. Players play against each other.

The main resource you pay with (for units, abilities etc.) is water, which is also the resource you must gather to win. Everything is in balance.

There are four kinds of terrain initally:
- Tundra     (Basic flat terrain, good for mounted units etc. No obstacles)
- Rocks      (Hard to pass terrain, can be used for hiding, good for meelee foot soldiers)
- Dunes      (Hard to pass terrain, good line of sight, good for ranged units, range advantage)
- Canyon     (Neutral ground, no unit particularly good or bad, can only be entered and left through entry points)

There are some terrain modifiers:
- Ruins      (Units can fortify and enjoy a defense bonus)
- Springs    (Unity on adjacent fields collect water and slowly regenerate health, but get a debuff on their attack and defense that grows with the amount of time spent collecting)
- Shrines    (Used for spawning units, the spawning process can be initiated by a player if only him has units adjacent to the shrine. One unit can be spawned per shrine and it takes a certain amount of rounds to appear. The cost and time scales inversely with the strength of the player. The weaker you are, the quicker you get your unit. Other players can reverse the spawning process. The ritual can be disrupted by having the most units adjacent to the shrine in your turn)
- Sandstorm  (Powerful tool to hide your units - but be aware, there is a risk involved. There is a small chance that a unit gets lost and vanishes from the map for a few turns until it reappears on a random at the boundary of the sandstorm, visibilty is reduced to a small radius around units in the sandstorm, the sandstorm moves "randomly" over the map until it vanishes)

Units in tribes of dust have a variety of stats:
- Health     (If the health drops to zero, the unit enters its death-state)
- Water      (The amount of water the unit currently has, if the value goes to zero, the unit enters its parched-state. Units can share water with adjacent units, which can be toggled on and off. Units that are sharing water get a cooldown of one round to all other abilities in the round they gave or received water)
- Capacity   (The amount of water the unit can carry)
- Attack     (The amount of health damage an attack by this unit causes. Different units can have different attack ranges)
- Range      (The number of total movements a unit can perform. Different tiles can cost different amounts of movement points for different units)

Units can only occupy tiles that are not occupied by other units. Stacking is not allowed. Soldiers excert as zone of control.

There are five basic unit types that come in different variants for different tribes:
- Meelee
- Ranged
- Mounted
- Support
- Carrier

There are four tribes initially each with special abilities:
- Romans   (Soldiers: Pilum, a thrown weapon on a cooldown with increased range, Support: Can pray to the gods for a few turns, then gives a short-term bonus to all units adjacent to the support. The support is immobile while praying)
- Druids   (Support: Drain life from any adjacent unit and convert it into water. Revive a fallen warrior by paying in equal amounts the health of the dead unit from the health of units surrounding it. Ritual takes a few turns to complete. Life cost is restored to one point per turn after the ritual is completed, up to the amount of health paid. Any heal draws first from the blood-debt)
- Pirates  (Ranged: Cannoneer, three range soldier, can group up with other cannoneers to fire a powerful cannon shot that pierces through enemies in a line, Support: Shanty signer, sings depressing songs from the long lost time on the sea, pirates get drunk and the next attack against them misses, but there is a twenty percent chance the pirates attack friendlies)
- Inuit    (Mounted: Ice bear rider, first, only the rider dies and the ice bear continues fighting, but fights on its own, not under the control of the player, Support: Walrusser, has a pet walrus that he can command to jump into a group of enemies, displacing the enemies and causing a small amount of damage)

The tribes furthermore each come with a special tribe-wide passive ability:
- Romans   (Can position units in patterns to gain various boni for the involved units [Cost?])
- Druids   (Dead druids leave a ghost behind, which distribute their water to adjacent druids and act as a tile blocker for enemy units. They vanish when they run out of water)
- Pirates  (Whenever something spawns, a parrot lifts of off the shoulder of a pirate and flies to that location to reveal the area)
- Inuit    (Random wild ice bears appear on the map, that can be recruited, but not controlled by the inuit, ice bears also consume water. Other tribes are attacked by the ice bears if they come too close)
